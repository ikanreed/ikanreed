- 👋 Hi, I’m @ikanreed
- 👀 I’m interested in 
-- 🧠 cheap hacky abuses of existing pretrained machine learning modules to make useful stuff with them.  Especially pytorch, but flexible
-- 🐍 python applications of obscure use, leaning towards django web-apps, but often smaller
-- 🥅 .NET stuff, especially MVVM guis
-- 📷 any sort of image processing
-- 💎 shaders and rendering
-- 🛠 automated build pipelines
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
-- Mostly azure devops, 
-- But I do want to figure out how to train transformers effectively
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you got.  I'm a busy guy but I like helping.
- 📫 How to reach me: uh.  dunno.
